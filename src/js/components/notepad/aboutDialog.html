    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Notepad</em> project is a simple, single page app allowing users to enter quick notes.
        In order to do that user needs to click on icon at the bottom right corner,
        which opens a small dialog where user can enter note text. Note is being added after a second user
        has clicked on add note button. Additionally it will also appear on main page after
        2 seconds from initial click.
        <br />
        It is written in Angular 1.6.3 using ES6 + Babel, has different components (Notepad, NoteDialog, NotesList)
        which are covered by unit tests using Jasmine and Karma.
    </p>

    <h3>Component structure</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><em>Notepad component</em></dt>
        <dd>
            It serves as main component and entry point for the app. Notepad component is responsible to
            importing dependant components and holding basic logic for maintaining this dialog.
        </dd>
        <dt><em>NotepadDialog component</em></dt>
        <dd>
            It holds logic of opening a small dialog (popover), entering notes by user
            (makes sure they are safe by usage of Angular's <em>$sce.trustAsHtml()</em> method),
            displaying them in a popover and firing event about note has been added by user,
            so that other interested components of the system can handle that.
            <br />
            Additionally component scrolls down popover content automatically,
            so that user can always see last note he/she has added.
        </dd>
        <dt><em>NotesList component</em></dt>
        <dd>
            This component is responsible for handling event from NoteDialog component about note being added by user,
            and adding that note also to the main page for user's convenience.
            <br />
            This compoenent also scrolls down page content automatically,
            so that user can always see last note he/she has added.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Tests</h3>
    <p>
        NotepadDialog and NotesList components are covered with unit tests using Jasmine and Karma.

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> using Twitter Bootstrap as a CSS framework for general styling and resposivness</li>
        <li> using https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap as Bootstrap's javascript adaptation for Angular
        to have basic Bootstrap js components as Angular directives/components: Popover, Dialog, ...
        </li>
        <li>using SASS to write styles for components</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bundling</h3>

            <li><em>npm install</em> - after cloning repo into your machine, run this at first to fetch all dependencies</li>
            <li><em>npm start</em> - run this to start serving project locally (e.g. http://localhost:8080/).
            Additionally applies eslint to project sources.</li>
            <li><em>npm run build</em> - bundles (contact, minify/uglify) entire project into dist/ folder</li>
            <li><em>npm test</em> - runs all mentioned tests</li>
        </ul>
